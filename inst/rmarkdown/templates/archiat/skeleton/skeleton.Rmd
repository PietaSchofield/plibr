# Introduction

The rational to this is to ensure that the inequalities bit of the protocol is thought out fully. I have
decided to use the [ForEquity HIAT approach][hiat] partly because it is there and partly because it is
an ARC NW developed tool. Because the SPRINT project is an ARC NW affiliated project it seems the right
approach to take at this point

## Mapping health inequalities relevant to your research

### Purpose:

All research topics have dimensions of inequalities. Identifying and mapping those most relevant to your
topic will ensure that an equity lens is integrated throughout the research process.

    Health inequalities have overlapping and interacting dimensions across social 
    categories. The term social category refers to people who share a particular 
    characteristic. 
    
    Examples of social categories include:
    1. people who identify as women, men or non-binary; 
    2. people sharing a religion, sexual orientation or ethnic identity; 
    3. people in different age groups; people with disabilities; 
    4. and people in different social classes. 
    
    A society’s systems of discrimination, stigmatisation and resource allocation 
    associated with these social categories – sexism, racism, classism, disablism, 
    ageism – create inequalities in living and working conditions, and in the control 
    people have in their lives. Individuals are members of multiple social categories 
    and may therefore be impacted by overlapping or intersecting systems of 
    discrimination and disadvantage (e.g. women of colour living on low incomes). These 
    systems are sometimes called ‘structural’ because they arise from the way societies are
    organised and they lead in turn to health inequalities.

Existing literature will help in this mapping but the knowledge of people with relevant lived experience,
and policy makers and practitioners in the field, is just as important.

## Integrating an intersectional equity lens into research questions

### Purpose:

Integrating relevant dimensions of intersectional inequalities into your research questions will ensure
that these are central to your study design and will be addressed throughout the research process. To do
this requires a good understanding of the social context of the research topic.

To understand the dimensions of inequalities relevant to a particular topic, two issues need to be
considered: (1) whether people in different social categories will have differential (unequal)
experiences or outcomes, and (2) which structural factors may create these. Research that illuminates how
the conditions in which people live and work impact on their lives and health rather than focusing only
on individual biological factors (e.g. age, sex) or behavioural characteristics (e.g. diet) will help
decision-makers to design more effective action to address social and health inequalities.

Section 1 of the HIAT encourages you to identify the inequalities relevant to your topic by exploring
existing research and involving people with relevant lived experience or practice/policy expertise. This
section encourages you to consider how to integrate these dimensions into your research questions.

### Reflection:


## Designing and conducting research sensitive to inequalities

The design of any study is determined by the problem or questions it aims to address. It is more likely
that research will be sensitive to inequalities if the researchers start off with a good understanding of
what is known about the dimensions of intersectional inequalities relevant to the topic they wish to
study (HIAT section 1), and if they integrate these into the way the problem or research questions are
framed including any theory of change or logic model that has been developed. (HIAT section 2).

To design and conduct studies that take account of relevant intersecting dimensions of inequalities
requires careful consideration of the specification of data to be used, how data will be obtained and
analysed, and who will be involved in interpreting the findings.

Whether your study involves a systematic review, uses primary or secondary data, or involves
quantitative, qualitative or mixed method designs, three key elements will determine how sensitive to
inequalities it is:

    1. If the available data and the analytical techniques used enable exploration of 
       differential experiences or outcomes across intersecting social categories 
       (e.g. gender, race, and class).
    2. If your data and analytical techniques can illuminate the causes of any differential
       experiences/outcomes identified, moving beyond proximal factors (such as aspects
       of lifestyle) to consider the role of structural drivers of inequality such as 
       powerlessness, stigma, and material disadvantage.
    3. If people with lived experience and other relevant stakeholders are involved as 
       equal partners in the design and conduct of your research and interpretation of 
       findings.

### Reflection:


## Prioritising findings relevant to action on inequalities in reporting and dissemination

### Purpose:

Research sensitive to inequalities is more likely to produce evidence that can help increase the
acceptability and effectiveness of action to reduce social and health inequalities. However, maximising
the positive impact of research evidence, and avoiding unintended negative impacts, require careful
consideration when deciding on how to report and disseminate research findings.

Dissemination is a communication process that aims to exchange knowledge for use in ways that lead to
improvements. Successful dissemination requires clear and accessible messages, appropriate products based
on these, directed at relevant audiences through appropriate channels (Ordonez and Serrat 2017). There
are important considerations to each of these elements, if the aim is to contribute to action to reduce
health inequalities.

## Principles for research that is sensitive to intersectional inequalities

Social and health inequalities are found everywhere, but some societies are more unequal than others.
Some low-income countries have relatively good population health outcomes despite their lower level of
economic development whilst some high-income countries, like the UK and USA are doing relatively badly
(Freeman et al. 2020). These inequalities result from long standing social structures that determine the
unequal distribution of power and resources.

People doing research often make recommendations for policies, professional practice and other actions
that can impact on these inequalities positively or negatively [see HIAT section 4]. For this reason,
there is a growing debate about what responsibilities researchers should have. Three possible principles
for research sensitive to inequalities practice are presented below along with examples of resources that
may help you reflect on these.

Principle 1. Researchers can work to remove their implicit biases.

These biases can reinforce negative stereotypes and contribute to stigma. Reflecting on potential bias
and involving people with lived experience of the problems being studied in discussions about them will
reduce this risk.

The Association Test [please note you will need to register to access it] has been developed to support
research teams to discuss these issues in a constructive manner at any point in the research process.

The Stanford Gendered Innovations Website on Science and Medicine also provides resources to help
researchers to think about the role of language in restricting knowledge production and perpetuating
inequalities.

Principle 2. Research can be designed and conducted in ways that challenge inequities.

This is the main focus of the HIAT tool but other resources that help support the development of research
that explicitly challenges social and health inequalities are included in the FOR Equity inventory.

Principle 3. Research practices can positively promote greater equity.

These include practices that ensure inclusive approaches to the composition of the research team and
establishing positive respectful relationships between team members. It also includes thinking how public
and other expert advisers are recruited, rewarded and acknowledged for their contribution to studies.
Some of the resources that can help you think about these issues are highlighted below:

A set of standards for public involvement in research has been produced by a national partnership group
which included members of the public who had been involved in research as well as researchers and
research funders. The standards cover the six dimensions of involvement shown in the image. 

Work funded by the European Commission produced the following checklist to support the development of
research practice sensitive to inequalities:

    1. Are you considering how you can increase diversity in your project team?
    2. Have you recruited people with relevant lived experience onto your team?
    3. Are you discouraging hierarchical relations in your team?

Five principles developed by the US research organisation Child Trends have a particular focus on racial
equity. They argue that these principles can be applied in any field to improve understanding of how to
use research to create greater equity with a particular focus on racial equity:

    Examine our own backgrounds and biases; 
    1. Commit to digging deeper into the data; 
    2. Recognize research process impacts communities; 
    3. researchers play a role in ensuring their research benefits communities;
    4. Engage communities as partners in research and credit them for their contribution; 
    5. Guard against the implied or explicit assumption that white is the normative, standard, or default
       position.

The CCGHR (Canadian Coalition of Global Health Research Principles for Global Health Research) is a framework to guide how to integrate equity considerations into everyday research, knowledge translation, and practice activities. The resource comprises six principles: authentic partnering, inclusion, shared benefits, commitment to the future, responsiveness to causes of inequities, and humility.

The English National Institute for Health Research has produced resources for members of the public who want to get involved in research and for researchers:

    1. A brief guide to public involvement in funding applications (2020);
    2. Patients, Carers and the Public
