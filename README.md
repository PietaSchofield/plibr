# PLIBR GitHub fork of my own original plib package

## What it is

It is now basically a collection of convenience functions for managing my Rmarkdown/HTML notebook pages.
Most of it is redundent.

I am trying to migrate some of the more work specific stuff to other packages in particular [R Tools for
Routine Health Data](https://github.com/PietaSchofield/rtrhd)

## What it was

A collection of R functions for submitting jobs to Sun Grid Engine SGE/PBS clusters and Slurm Clusters 
and managing MPI jobs whan I was working in bioinformatics mixed with a bunch of functions for some
bioinformatics file parsers.

There was also a bunch of stuff for making working on MacOS less of a pain when I was really wanting to
be working on Linux
