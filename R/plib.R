#' A library of convenience functions to make life easier while produce workday notebooks to record what
#' I have been doing inparticular submitting and running processing jobs on the cluster. This library
#' used to exist as two separate libraries, my original pietalib that I started at Dundee and a CRUKlib
#' that I started at CRUK Manchester. However it makes more sense to combine these now.
