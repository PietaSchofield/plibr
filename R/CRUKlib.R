#' CRUKlib 
#'
#' This is a library of functions I have written to ease my work at CRUK Manchester Institute 
#' It comprises of various functions for accessing the job queuing system of troodon and submitting 
#' jobs. I also has some plot functions for standard plots. It will probably integrate with the 
#' snakemake pipeline system when that comes on stream
