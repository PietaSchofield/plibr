#' Latest iteration of my convenience function code for managing Rmarkdown wrangling for creating
#' electronic notebooks
#'
#' A library of convenience functions to make life easier while produce workday notebooks to record what
#' I have been doing in particular submitting and running processing jobs on the cluster. This library
#' used to exist as two separate libraries, my original pietalib that I started at Dundee and a CRUKlib
#' that I started at CRUK Manchester. However it makes more sense to combine these now.
#'
#' Most of this is redundant code now but I am loathed to lose it certainly all the batch-job submission
#' management for bioinformatics jobs is not distant history
